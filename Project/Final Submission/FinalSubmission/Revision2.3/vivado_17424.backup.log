CRITICAL WARNING: [BD 41-1348] Reset pin /Top_0/reset (associated clock /Top_0/Clk) is connected to asynchronous reset source /reset.
This may prevent design from meeting timing. Please add Processor System Reset module to create a reset that is synchronous to the associated clock source /clk_wiz_0/clk_slow.

WARNING: [BD 41-927] Following properties on pin /rgb2dvi_0/PixelClk have been updated from connected ip, but BD cell '/rgb2dvi_0' does not accept parameter changes, so they may not be synchronized with cell properties:
	PHASE = 0.0 
Please resolve any mismatches by directly setting properties on BD cell </rgb2dvi_0> to completely resolve these warnings.
